* Realistic tasks
** Global Refactoring
- [-] Business logic
  - [ ] application
  - [ ] instance_renderer
  - [X] logs
  - [X] main
  - [X] render_structs
  - [ ] window
- [ ] Vulkan
  - [ ] buffer
  - [ ] command buffer
  - [ ] command pool
  - [ ] device
  - [ ] device memory
  - [ ] instance
  - [ ] physical device
  - [ ] queue
  - [ ] shader module
  - [ ] swapchain
  - [ ] templates
  - [ ] tools
- [ ] Shaders

* Far future tasks
** [ ] If this is checked, you are really cool
  - [ ] Choose physical device
  - [ ] Swapchain
    - [ ] Choose: format, present mode, transform and extend
  - [X] Create several queues of same family if possible
  - [ ] Pipeline dynamic state (why the fuck do i need it)
  - [ ] Refactor vk::DeviceMemory or completely remake

    
** Ideas
- Maybe create render pass class (pobably not)
- Create barrier class
- Lear more about pipeline rasterization state
